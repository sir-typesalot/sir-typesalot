# Hi, I'm Radhe Shyam
Welcome to my Github, it's a simple space.   
I am a Junior Software Developer with most of my experience in full-stack development (primarily back-end).    
Learning is a lifelong process for me. I am always reading up on new skills and ways that I can improve my current skillset by trying to apply what I know into projects that I take interest in. I take great insterest in data-heavy projects and like to play around with data management tools as well.
