# Hi, I'm Radhe Shyam
Welcome to my Github, it's a simple space.   
I am a Junior Developer with experience in back-end development, console app programming, as well as front-end development.    
Learning is a lifelong process for me. I am always reading up on new skills and ways that I can improve my current skillset by trying to apply what I know into projects that I take interest in. I love working with databases and have experience in both relational and non-relational database systems.
