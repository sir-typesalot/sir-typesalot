# Hi, I'm Radhe Shyam
Welcome to my Github, it's a simple space.   
I love to learn and apply whatever I know by creating new projects that I take interest in. I like working with databases and back-end programming, but I also find front-end development equally as interesting.

My languages of choice are:   
- Python
- Javascript
- C++   
- C# 

## My Projects
🟡 I'm currently working on <a href="https://chomping-chimp.github.io/index.html">Exercise Explorer</a>, a website that helps you choose exercises for a workout.   
✔️ I've made a <a href="https://github.com/chomping-chimp/Check-In-App">Visitor Check In App</a> as a Proof of Concept Project while at one of my previous jobs.   
✔️ I just released the inital version of the <a href="https://github.com/chomping-chimp/IdeaLog">Idea Log</a> to help me write down and view my ideas for projects. I still have some features that I'd like to see implemented, so I still have some development to do.   
I have some more that are still in the works, feel free to take a look 👀
